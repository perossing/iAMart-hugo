iAMart negotiates discounts, rebates, shipping terms, and payment terms that **enable retail members to source products more conveniently and offer more competitive prices to our customers**. As a volunteer-run organization, members are actively involved in communicating with vendors to **build and maintain relationships that meet our needs as independent small businesses**.

iAMart stores also provide an invaluable network of information and support. It's good to have friends in the industry!

To apply for membership, a store must:

* sell fine-art materials as its primary business
* have been in business as a brick-and-mortar retailer for a minimum of three years
* be in good standing with suppliers
* have no more than three physical retail locations
* be sponsored for membership by a member store

To inquire about becoming an iAMart member, contact our **Membership Chair**: membership@iamart.org.
